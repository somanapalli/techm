5)Find the highest mark

Raj is a professor who handles Mathematics ,he wants to conduct evaluation for the students.He wants to find the highest mark among the students to give the proficiency .
Write a Java program to help Raj. (Assume 6 set of marks provided always)

Sample Input 1 : 
89 
90
67
78
98
76
Sample Output 1 :
Highest mark is 98 
Sample Input 2:
96
-89
Sample Output 2 :
Invalid mark

Pass and Fail Count

Ram has passed in certain subjects and failed in a few. Write a program to count the no of subjects he passed in and the no of subjects he has failed in. Marks scored below 50 is considered as failed. If Ram has passed in all the subjects print "Ram passed in all subjects" and if failed print "Ram failed in all subjects".
Assume maximum size of array is 20,

Sample Input 1:
Enter the no of subjects:
6
60
70
80
90
45
49
Sample Output 1:
Ram passed in 4 subjects and failed in 2 subjects

Sample Input 2:
Enter the no of subjects:
0
Sample Output 2:
Invalid input range

Sample Input 3:
Enter the no of subjects:
-2
Sample Output 3:
Invalid input range

Palindrome

Astrologist believes that having a palindromic name is very auspicious . As we all know, a palindrome is a word that can be read the same way in either direction.There should not be a space or any special character in the word entered. If yes, display "Invalid Input". Write a Java program to determine whether a given word is a palindrome or not.

Sample Input 1:
Enter the word : 
Malayalam
Sample Output 1: 
Malayalam is a Palindrome
Sample Input 2:
Enter the word : 
Apple
Sample Output 2: 
Apple is not a Palindrome
Sample Input 3:
Enter the word : 
no on
Sample Output 3: 
Invalid Input
Sample Input 4:
Enter the word : 
@nnn
Sample Output 4: 
Invalid Input


8)
Count occurrence of a character
Raji wants to count the no of occurrences of the given character.Write a program to accept a word from the user. Get a character from the user and find the no of occurrences . 
Check whether the given character and word is valid
The word is valid if it contains only alphabets and no space or any special characters or numbers.
The character is valid if it is an alphabet alone.
Sample Input 1:
Enter a word:
programming
Enter the character:
m
Sample Output 1:
No of 'm' present in the given word is 2.
Sample Input 2:
Enter a word:
programming
Enter the character:
s
Sample Output 2:
The given character 's' not present in the given word.
Sample Input 3:
Enter a word:
56
Sample Output 3:
Not a valid string
Sample Input 4:
Enter a word:
Hello
Enter the character:
6
Sample Output 4:
Given character is not an alphabet
