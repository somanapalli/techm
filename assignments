BankAccountDetails
In the first round of HR interview for a banking sector,  HR decides to make candidates design an application which provides only  information on transaction like amount withdrawn with respect to fields given. Develop a program to implement this scenario. 
Create a class Account with the attributes: 
•	accountId  int
•	accountType String 
•	balance int
The method boolean withdraw(int) used  to calculate the current balance of the respective account. Before that it should enough balance.  If there is enough balance, deduct the amount from the balance and print "Balance amount after withdraw: XXX" and return true.  If there is no enough balance, print "Sorry!!! No enough balance" and return false. 
Create a class AccountDetails with main function and the below methods :
•	public Account getAccountDetails() -  This methods gets the input related to Account from the user and returns the Account object with all values set.  If the input given for balance is less than or equal to zero, consider it as invalid and display "Balance should be positive". Continue this kind of evaluation till user enters a positive value.

•	public int getWithdrawAmount() -  This methods gets the amount to be withdrawn as input from the user and returns the same.  If the input given for amount is less than or equal to zero, consider it as invalid and display "Amount should be positive". Continue this kind of evaluation till user enters a positive value.
Use appropriate getters and setters.
Sample input 1:
Enter account id:
100
Enter account type:
Savings
Enter balance:
10000
Enter amount to be withdrawn:
500
Sample Output 1:
Balance amount after withdraw: 9500

Sample input 3:
Enter account id:
100
Enter account type:
Savings
Enter balance:
-100
Balance should be positive
Enter balance:
5000
Enter amount to be withdrawn:
500
Sample Output 1:

Register a Candidate - User defined Exception(with throw and throws) 
Geneva Technologies is planning to conduct a Walk-in interview. The interview has 4 levels. To attend the interview, the candidates need to register the following information:
Name, Gender and Expected salary.
Help him do this by writing a java program.
Partial code is provided.
You are provided with a public class Candidate with private attributes :
                        String name
                        String gender
                        double expectedSalary
            Appropriate getter and setters are provided.
            You are provided with a public class Main.
Write a method getCandidateDetails as –
            public static Candidate getCandidateDetails() – This method should get the candidate details, create the Candidate object using those details and return that object.
If the candidate’s expected salary is less than 10000
               •   throw a user defined exception as InvalidSalaryException with the message “Registration Failed. Salary cannot be less than 10000.” and return null.
               •    this method should throw / propagate InvalidSalaryException.

To do this, write a class InvalidSalaryException that inherits Exception class.
Write a constructor that takes a String as argument and set this string to the message attribute of the super class, Exception.
In the Main class, write the main method and test the method getCandidateDetails.
If it returns a valid Candidate object, then  display  “Registration Successful”.
Use a catch block to handle the exception that is returned by the method getCandidateDetails. In catch block display the message by using the getMessage() method.
Sample Input 1:
Enter the candidate Details
Name
Margrett
Gender
Female
Expected Salary
50000
 
Sample Output 1:
Registration Successful
 
Sample Input 2:
Enter the candidate Details
Name
Robin
Gender
Male
Expected Salary
5000
 Sample Output 2:
Registration Failed. Salary cannot be less than 10000.
