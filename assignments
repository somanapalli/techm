10)Book Detail
Create a class Book with the following private member variables
•	String bookName
•	int bookPrice 
•	String authorName
Include appropriate getters and setters method.
Create a class TestBook which has the main method.  Get the details as shown in the sample input. Create an object for book class and assign the value for its attrbutes using the setters.  Print the output as shown in the sample output using the getters method. 
Note: Use the same attribute names as given in the question and camel case notation for methods.  Name of book and author can have space in between.

Sample Input 1:
Enter the Book name:
Java
Enter the price:
500
Enter the Author name:
Einstein
Sample Output 1:
Book Details
Book Name :Java
Book Price :500
Author Name :Einstein

Employee Salary Calculation
Create a class Employee with the following private member variables.
•	int employeeId
•	String employeeName
•	double salary
•	double netSalary

Include appropriate getters and setters method in Employee class. Write the following method in the Employee class:
public void calculateNetSalary(int pfpercentage)  - This method should take PF percentage as argument. Deduct the PF amount from the salary and set the netSalary.  

Create a Main class which has the main method which invokes the method to get the input and prints the details as shown in the sample. 
Also write a method :
   public static Employee getEmployeeDetails() -  which gets the employee details and returns the employee object.
   
public static int getPFPercentage() -  which gets the PF percentage and returns the same
Sample Input 1:
Enter Id:
101
Enter Name:
Vivek
Enter salary:
20000
Enter PF percentage:
7
Sample Output 1:
Id : 101
Name : Vivek
Salary : 20000.0
Net Salary : 18600.0

Ticket Price Calculation - Static
Ticket Calculation
Create a class Ticket with the following private variables
int ticketid;
int price;
static int availableTickets;

Include getters and setters methods in the Ticket class.
AvailableTickets should hold only positive value. Zero and negative values are not allowed.(This logic should be checked inside the corresponding setter method)
Write the following method in the Ticket class:
public int calculateTicketCost(int nooftickets) —this method should check the ticket availability, If the tickets are available, reduce the nooftickets from availableTickets and calculate the total amount as nooftickets*price  and return the total amount.  If the tickets are not available, this method should return -1.
Write a main method in the Main class to test the application.
Sample input and output
Enter no of bookings:
2
Enter the available tickets:
25
Enter the ticketid:
123
Enter the price:
100
Enter the no of tickets:
5
Available tickets: 25
Total amount:500
Available ticket after booking:20
Enter the ticketid:
124
Enter the price:
100
Enter the no of tickets:
2
Available tickets: 20
Total amount:200
Available ticket after booking:18
Sample input and output 2:
Enter no of bookings:
1
Enter the available tickets:
25
Enter the ticketid:
123
Enter the price:
100
Enter the no of tickets:

BankAccountDetails
In the first round of HR interview for a banking sector,  HR decides to make candidates design an application which provides only  information on transaction like amount withdrawn with respect to fields given. Develop a program to implement this scenario. 
Create a class Account with the attributes: 
•	accountId  int
•	accountType String 
•	balance int
The method boolean withdraw(int) used  to calculate the current balance of the respective account. Before that it should enough balance.  If there is enough balance, deduct the amount from the balance and print "Balance amount after withdraw: XXX" and return true.  If there is no enough balance, print "Sorry!!! No enough balance" and return false. 
Create a class AccountDetails with main function and the below methods :
•	public Account getAccountDetails() -  This methods gets the input related to Account from the user and returns the Account object with all values set.  If the input given for balance is less than or equal to zero, consider it as invalid and display "Balance should be positive". Continue this kind of evaluation till user enters a positive value.

•	public int getWithdrawAmount() -  This methods gets the amount to be withdrawn as input from the user and returns the same.  If the input given for amount is less than or equal to zero, consider it as invalid and display "Amount should be positive". Continue this kind of evaluation till user enters a positive value.
Use appropriate getters and setters.
Sample input 1:
Enter account id:
100
Enter account type:
Savings
Enter balance:
10000
Enter amount to be withdrawn:
500
Sample Output 1:
Balance amount after withdraw: 9500
Sample input 2:
Enter account id:
101
Enter account type:
Savings
Enter balance:
1000
Enter amount to be withdrawn:
1500
Sample Output 2:
Sorry!!! No enough balance

Sample input 3:
Enter account id:
100
Enter account type:
Savings
Enter balance:
-100
Balance should be positive
Enter balance:
5000
Enter amount to be withdrawn:
500
Sample Output 1:
Balance amount after withdraw: 4500
